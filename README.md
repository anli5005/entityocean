# Entityocean
Entityocean is a Kotlin library designed for parsing and interacting with [Itempool](https://itempool.com), a surveying tool commonly used live in 3blue1brown's [Lockdown Math series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppWPuXsnf1Q&list=PLZHQObOWTQDP5CVelJJ1bNDouqrAhVPev).

The library makes extensive use of Kotlin coroutines, so it is effectively Kotlin-only.
